# Maven-Roasters-Coffee-Shop-Analytics-Dashboard-Excel
This repository presents two dynamic Excel dashboards developed to analyze and visualize sales performance and customer behavior for **Maven Roasters Coffee Shop**. These dashboards are designed to provide clear, actionable insights for data-driven decision-making in retail and F&B environments


##  Project Overview

This project includes:

- **Sales Insights Dashboard**  
  An in-depth view of revenue trends, top-selling products, store-wise performance, and category-wise contribution.

- **Customer Behaviour Overview Dashboard**  
  A focused analysis of customer footfall patterns across time, days, and store locations.

These dashboards aim to simulate a real-world business intelligence setup often used by retail operations, marketing, and executive teams to understand key performance metrics.
